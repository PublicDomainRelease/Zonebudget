NAME
       zonebdgt - Program for computing subregional water budgets for
                  MODFLOW ground-water flow models

ABSTRACT
       Zonebudget (ZONEBDGT) is a computer program that computes
       subregional water budgets using results from the MODFLOW ground-
       water flow model.  The user designates the subregions by specifying
       zone numbers.  A separate budget is computed for each zone.  The
       budget for a zone includes a component of flow between each adjacent
       zone.

METHOD
       ZONEBDGT reads a file of budget data that MODFLOW can write.  This
       file must contain values for each flow component at every model
       cell.  ZONEBDGT then accumulates each flow component for all the
       cells in each specified zone.

HISTORY
       Version 1.0 1996/12/20 - version published in USGS OFR 90-392.  Note
          that this version will not work with cell-by-cell budget files
          that are written using the optional compact format available in
          MODFLOW-96.  That is, to use ZONEBDGT version 1.0 with
          MODFLOW-96, the compact cell-by-cell budget option must NOT be
          used.

DATA REQUIREMENTS
       In order to use ZONEBDGT, all cell-by-cell budget terms for a
       MODFLOW simulation must be saved in a file when MODFLOW is executed.
       The cell-by-cell budget file must be written in the format used by
       MODFLOW-88 (as opposed to the COMPACT format, which is a new option
       in MODFLOW-96).  Depending on the specific zones that are desired, a
       zone file must also be prepared.

OUTPUT OPTIONS
       The output is a listing file that contains a flow budget for each
       zone.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       ZONEBDGT is written in Fortran 77.  By default, the software is
       dimensioned for use with models having up to 90,000 cells.
       Generally, the program is easily installed on most computer systems.
       The code has been used on UNIX-based computers and DOS-based 386 or
       greater computers having a math coprocessor and 2 mb of memory.
