A. FILES

The following self-extracting DOS distribution files (containing the software,
test data sets, and information files) are currently available for DOS
computer systems:

         znbd1_0.exe  - Compiled using Lahey Fortran 90 with source code
         znbd1_0b.exe - Compiled using Lahey Fortran 90 (binaries only)
         znbd1_0s.exe - Source code

For use on personal computers, the program source code consists of the
following files (found in the zonebdgt.1_0\src directory):

    zonebdgt.for
    Makefile -- input instructions to the Lahey "make" utility for
                compiling ZONEBDGT

Included in directory zonebdgt.1_0/doc is a Portable Document Format (PDF)
version of the ZONEBUDGET documentatoin (ofr90392.pdf).  A PostScript
version of this report is available from:
      http://water.usgs.gov/software/zonebdgt.html

The PDF file is readable and printable on various computer platforms using
Acrobat Reader from Adobe.  The Acrobat Reader is freely available from
the following World Wide Web sites:
      http://www.adobe.com/
      http://www.shareware.com/

and by File Transfer Protocol (FTP) from the following site:
      ftp.adobe.com (path: /pub/adobe/acrobat)


B. EXTRACTING FILES

For whichever ZONEBDGT distribution file that you have acquired, znbd1_0.exe,
znbd1_0b.exe, or znbd1_0s.exe, the directory zonebdgt.1_0 is created (or
overwritten) when the files are extracted.  If the zonebdgt.1_0 directory
already exists, you may want to delete or rename it before extracting the
files.  The following are the steps to extract the files from a distribution
file.  Note, replace <disk drive> with the drive letter where you want to
install ZONEBDGT and optionally replace [directory] with the name of a
directory on that drive:

   1. If you are not in the directory where the distribution file is
      located, go there.  For example (if already on the C disk drive):

         cd c:\wrdapp

   2. Extract the files using the command:

        znbd1_0 -d -o <disk drive>:\[directory]

      Substitute "znbd1_0b" or "znbd1_0s" for "znbd1_0" if you are
      installing the executable-code-only or source-code distributions,
      respectively.  Note, be sure to include the -d (restore directory
      structure) and -o (overwrite existing files) options and ":\" in 
      the command.  Examples are:

         znbd1_0 -d -o c:\

         znbd1_0 -d -o c:\wrdapp

The following directory structure will be created (the contents of each
directory are shown to the right):

      zonebdgt.1_0      ; copy of this readme file
        `-----bin       ; compiled executable and Lahey error file
        `-----doc       ; documentation files
        `-----src       ; makefile and source code
        `-----test      ; batch files to run verification tests
        `-----data      ; standard data sets used in verification tests

Notes:
a) The executable is not included in the znbd1_0s.exe distribution file.
b) The source code is not included in the znbd1_0b.exe distribution file.
c) It is recommended that no user files are kept in the zonebdgt.1_0
   directory structure.  If you do plan to put files in the zonebdgt.1_0
   directory structure, do so only by creating subdirectories of
   zonebdgt.1_0.
d) Brackets "[xxx]" are used to indicate optional arguments to commands.


C. COMPILING

The source code is provided in the znbd1_0.exe and znbd1_0s.exe distribution
files so that users can generate the executable themselves.  No support can
be provided for users generating their own versions of the software.  In
general, the requirements are a Fortran compiler and a minimal level of
knowledge of the compiler and the DOS operating system.  As provided, the
makefile and source code are optimized for use on a Pentium personal
computer using the Lahey Fortran 90 compiler and supplied make program.

To generate a new executable, do the following:

   1. Change directory to the source directory:
         cd zonebdgt.1_0\src

   2. Modify the beginning of the file named makefile to correctly
      specify system-dependent variables:

         FFLAGS       Fortran compiler flags
         FC           Fortran compiler name
         LINKER       Fortran linker name
         LNKFLGS      Fortran linker flags

   3. Use the make program to initiate compilation of the source code
      and installation of the software:

         make [BINDIR=directory_for_executable]

      See the Installing instructions below for an explanation of BINDIR.

      The make will:
         a. create the directory zonebdgt.1_0\bin if it does not exist,
         b. compile the source code,
         c. place the executable (zonebdgt.exe) in zonebdgt.1_0\bin, and
         d. place a copy of the executable in BINDIR if specified.


D: INSTALLING

To make the ZONEBDGT program accessible from any directory, the directory
containing the executable should be included in the PATH environment
variable.  For example, you could add a line similar to the following
to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  PATH=%PATH%;C:\zonebdgt.1_0\bin

Note, substitute the appropriate drive letter and pathname if not C:\
as shown above.

As an alternative, the ZONEBDGT executable can be installed in a directory
already included in the PATH environment variable.  The makefile (input
instructions to the Lahey make program--located in zonebdgt.1_0\src) contains
instructions to optionally place a copy of the executable contained in
zonebdgt.1_0\bin in a specified directory.  Use the following two commands to
do this:

       cd zonebdgt_source_directory
       make install BINDIR=directory_for_executable

For example:

       cd C:\zonebdgt.1_0\src
       make install BINDIR=C:\wrdapp\bin

Note, the makefile may need to be modified to be used with make programs
other than the Lahey make program.


E. RUNNING THE SOFTWARE

        **System Requirements**
        - 386-based or higher personal computer with math co-processor
          running DOS.
        - 5 MB application RAM
        - 5 MB hard disk space

ZONEBDGT has been compiled using the Lahey Fortran 90 extended memory
compiler version 3.00f.  The file "LF90.EER" (from the Lahey compiler)
located in zonebdgt.1_0\bin contains error messages.  If an error occurs,
this file is used to print error messages if the zonebdgt.1_0\bin directory
is included in the PATH environment variable; if LF90.ERR cannot be found,
the error will only be identified by number.

The program arrays are dimensioned for models having up to 300,000 cells.

After ZONEBDGT is properly installed in a directory that is included in
your PATH, the program is initiated using the command:  zonebdgt.  The
program prompts for the following information:
     1) name of the LISTING FILE for results
     2) name of the CELL-BY-CELL BUDGET TERMS
     3) TITLE for use in LISTING FILE
     4) an option for specifying when budgets are calculated


F. TESTING

Test data sets are provided to verify that the program is correctly
installed and running on the system.  The tests may also be looked at
as examples of how to use the program.  The directory zonebdgt.1_0\test
contains batch files to run the tests.  The directory zonebdgt.1_0\data
contains the input data and expected results for each test.  Run the
tests in the zonebdgt.1_0\test directory using the command:

   test

After the tests are completed, the results can be compared to the
expected results.  To clean-up after the tests, type the command:

   clean

The tests are described in the table below.  Test is the test number,
program is the program used to run the test, and the usage column
indicates how a file is used, with i for input, o for output, and
i/o for both input and output.

IMPORTANT NOTE: use zbtest.nam and associated files to generate the cell-
by-cell flow data (zbtest.bud) using MODFLOW.  The zbtest.bud is a binary 
file that must be generated for each platform.  The one provided was 
generated on a Pentium personal computer.  The test.bat file does not run 
MODFLOW to generate the zbtest.bud, you must do this on your own.
